## Overview

Registers `plsr.Jail`. Seeds every new character with a `Jailed` field via the `Characters:Creating` middleware hook, and checks time-served against sentence duration on `Characters:Spawning` so a character logging back in past their release time comes back free automatically. Also covers in-cell contraband searchables, stashes, and crafting.

---

## Dependencies

- `pulsar_core` — framework core
- `pulsar_characters` — hooks `Characters:Creating`/`Characters:Spawning` to seed and check the `Jailed` field
- `pulsar_pwnzor` — anti-cheat check loaded alongside every resource
